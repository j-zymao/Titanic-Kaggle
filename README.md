Titanic Dataset

This model used the titanic survival dataset to predict the survival rate of the passengers.

Model: Logistic Regression from sickit learn was used in this project

Result: The accuracy score to predict the survival rate was 84%, I don't know if my process was accurate but the accuracy score seemed normal. From the predictions the variables that had the strongest realation to Titanic's survival rate was Sex and being a child. Being a male and staying in the first class also affected the survival rate. I have only tried Logistic Regression model for this project, but I have a feeling other models will get similar results around my accuracy scores.
